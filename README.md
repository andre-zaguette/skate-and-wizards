## Background

Ages ago, the world was civilized and protected by wise rulers wielding powerful magical items. However, barbarian warlords invaded from another dimension, turning the world into a wasteland. Now, remnants of their leaderless hordes wander the land, seeking to extinguish the embers of civilization. In this critical moment, a plea for help reaches the Skate Wizards, who preserve the last pure source of magic.

You are a Skate Wizard, a member of the Hermetic Order of Skate Wizards. You once roamed the lowlands but retreated to your sanctuary in the high mountains to immerse yourself in the mystical arts of skateboarding. Now, you descend to locate long-lost magical items that could rekindle the dying flames of civilization.

## Character Creation

Character creation involves six steps:

1. **Attributes**: Determine Strength, Dexterity, and Will.
2. **Health and Defense**: Start with 4 Health and 6 Defense.
3. **Permanent Spells**: Skate Wizards can cast Ramp, Sidewalk, and Rail at any time.
4. **Random Spells**: Receive one random spell per day.
5. **Bootleg Spells**: Prepare a Bootleg Spell each day from a collection of skate tricks.
6. **Items**: Choose three starting items from a provided list.

## Basic Rules

- **Danger Rolls**: Roll 2D6 and add the relevant bonus. A total of 10 or more avoids danger.
- **Opposed Rolls**: When characters act against each other, both roll 2D6, and the higher total wins.
- **Initiative**: Both sides roll a die at the start of combat, and the higher roll acts first.
- **Advantage and Disadvantage**: Roll 3D6 and use the highest two dice (advantage) or lowest two dice (disadvantage).
- **Combat**: Attack rolls (AR) are made with 2D6, compared against the defender's Defense Number (DN). Damage is the difference between the attack total and DN.
